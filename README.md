# GroupTabs
Chrome extension to quickly open groups of commonly used tabs.

### Create groups of commonly used tabs
Have websites that you frequently use together for different tasks or want to save for later? Create a new group and save yourself the time of having to open all of these sites individually when you next need them. With one click, you will have immediate access to all of these sites in a new browser window.

### Syncs across all of your devices
Whether on your computer, phone, or tablet, you can seamlessly access all of your groups from any device that has this Chrome extension installed.
